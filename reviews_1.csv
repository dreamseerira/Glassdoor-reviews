";
5;If you’re new to the financial industry than this may be the best place for you. You’ll learn tons in a relatively short amount of time. I’ve only been here for a few months and its done more for my professional development than any other company I’ve worked for prior to coming here (to be honest it was only one other but you should get my point). I’m excited to see what the future holds.;Management have their strict moments.;When morale starts to dip take decisive action to fix the issue.
5;I learned more in my time with the company than in the last decade of my life combined! It’s very fast-paced and working here for any length of time will certainly supercharge your professional development.;The company offers a lot of other benefits and perks which make up for the salary, but it’s still worth mentioning that they aren’t as competitive as other companies within the industry.;
5;The company goes out of its way to make sure employees aren’t overworking themselves. They host company events, offer catered lunches and dinners, and give as many employees as possible the option to work remotely. As far as start-ups go, Bunq really addresses work/life balance more than any other company I’ve worked at.;There really aren’t any company-specific cons to working at Bunq, only industry-specific. But then, you’d have to completely change industries to avoid those.;
3;You get to work on many projects and learn a lot;The structure of the marketing team is not productive enough. There is poor communication between the teams. A lot of micromanagement;
5;We’re changing the face of digital banking. It’s unchartered territory, and you feel that every day. Everyone who works here is extremely talented and knowledgeable, but most importantly, we’re all creative. You need to think outside of the box when you’re working for a company like Bunq that is doing things no one else is doing.;So far I would say the only con is that my supervisor tends to micromanage the employees directly under him. I can understand he wants to make sure everything is perfect, but it would be nice to feel more trusted in my role.;Trust the people you hire on. After all, you picked us for a reason.
5;Bunq has a strong, youthful start-up culture. It’s definitely a fun environment to work in and things are always changing. If you want to join a company where you feel like a valued part of the team, this is exactly where you need to be.;It’s a fast-paced environment. Which is par for the course when working at a tech start-up.;Don’t hire people who can’t keep up. If they don’t have experience at start-ups or don’t seem up to the task, we’re probably better off without them.
4;very international and young environment;"under market salaries; undervalued talents";
5;The working atmosphere is very pleasant with a laid-out structure for an organization where people can share feedback, ideas, and skills. Stress-free with work-life balance, amiable coworkers, talented professionals in the industry, and you really feel that you belong to the team. Every workday is an exciting day to achieve goals or simply learn new things, contribute to success, and grow professionally.;The schedule is not that flexible but gladly the location is nice!;
5;This company is as colorful as its logo. The team is really bright and talented. The employees are from all parts of the world so you get to learn about different cultures as well. There are lots of fun activities you can join after work like basketball or biking. Dinners are free and prepared by no less than a chef so you can just go home after work and recharge. The organizational structure is flat. Things get decided on fast. And you are both equipped and empowered to make business decisions too. Definitely lots of opportunities for growth and you get to move around Europe which is really beautiful and inspiring.;Young team operating at a fast pace – got to keep up! And work output is expected to be of the highest quality so you must work long and hard! But our team has gotten really close because we spend a lot of working hours together ensuring that we will deliver on the company’s vision.;
5;Bunq is a great company with a lot of room for growth at fast-paced environment. The organizational structure is flat and the team is dedicated. The peers are very co-operative and are always there to extend a helping hand. The office is at a nice location and has lunch and dinner facilities.;Flexible working hours or remote working possibilities.;
1;product is nice - people are surprisingly competent (given low compensation) and overall friendly - topic is challenging;- culture is poisonous - there's 0 strategy for the business (or it's not broadly shared) - compensation is bad (salaries are low, no bonus, no stock option) - the employee is always perceived as a risk (contract length, salaries);review HR strategy
5;I worked in startups my whole life and a huge % of them fail to recognise the importance of delivering quality at pace, runways are short and bunq has completely recognised that. Because of this I have no doubt that we will continue to grow, be successful and give all of our users what they want. The first company I have worked at that truly allows someone to take ownership, and full ownership. If you can understand how and why everything exists you will truly be able to do your best work. A tonne of incredibly smart people here.;Its not really a negative but if people dont grasp it they may find it hard, the environment is incredibly unique, everything that exists of for a reason and is measurable, this is not always the case in other companies, so it is a lot to take in and lot to wrap your head around in the early days, if you can do it and remove any dogma from the way you think or behave then you will have a huge amount of success;Keep going, doing something so unique is often misunderstood but it is this that makes bunq so interesting.
2;- You will have the chance to learn a lot at bunq, speak up and dare to submit your ideas!;work can be really intense;
5;Professional, diverse, and positive environment where I have had unique opportunities to meet real professionals and learn from them. The company provides an arena for showcasing your strengths and building on them. I feel like it’s the most fulfilling job I have ever had.;No pension scheme available yet;
1;I always wanted to experience the startup culture.;The company must be more flexible regarding working hours. allowing work from home and letting people work at their own pace. I was also not happy with the pay they provided. It was so low as compared to the work they expected.;Change some of the rigid policies.
1;DISCLAIMER: There are so many fake reviews here. If the review has a positive approval of the CEO, it's fake. I loved the people there. I made genuine friends at bunq and I'm constantly trying to find ways to get them out of there. Bad experiences are what unite our collective experience and we all bond quite quickly since we all suffer the treatment of the CEO. I learned a lot during my time at bunq and I honestly love the product. It's just such a shame the company self-sabotages constantly. But it's a great place to try new things and improve your skills. See it as an emotionally abusive bootcamp for your professional skills. The food used to be so good! And it's very international.;-Verbal abuse stories are extremely common. More so in the past than recently, but the entire company is scared of the CEO. -There's micromanaging 24/7. They ask you to report every single thing you do. A daily report after 6pm, a weekly report on Mondays, a weekly meeting with your team lead to keep you in check...pretty much 30% of your time is just reporting. -You need to be on the company Whatsapp chat, be reachable on Slack even on the weekends and if you work closely with the CEO you get scolded if you don't reply an email on a Saturday at 11pm (not exaggerating). -Your expertise doesn't really matter. It's whatever the CEO believes and if your opinion aligns with his, then good, if not, then back to the drawing board until you come up with something he likes. -You cannot trust HR. They pretty much facilitate the toxic environment. People don't last more than a year. Don't even bother learning people's names because they will probably leave within 3 months. Salaries are quite low. If you want a raise you need to reach unreasonable goals -If you're looking for experienced management, you won't find it here. People who know what they are doing quickly leave. I didn't even last a year there and I saw so many people come and go. -Your contract says 40 hours but with a 9-6 schedule you work 45 hours base, but most people are expected to work overtime and you are seen as the black sheep if you leave on time -EVERY Friday there's the weekly: A company meeting at 6pm that lasts 30-45min. of unpaid time where the CEO just rambles about how great his ideas are, how some teams are better than others and the next strategy to not go bankrupt. And it's mandatory to be there;"Stop writing fake reviews. Please don't deny this with your ""benefit-based"" communication because that backfires every time."
1;I generally like working for organizations that work like startups and share the responsibilities.;This company believes in setting unbelievable goals to motivate the employees to do better every day. What they don't understand employees need the satisfaction of doing a task successfully from time to time. Unachievable goals eventually kill motivation.;There should be a limit to how much you push your employees.
2;Nice colleagues and often fun, decent lunch;Low salary, poor upper management and ceo leadership, a lot of extra hours;Change the management
1;Most guys your work with are nice and very knowledgeable.;It's a very demanding place to work You end up working very long hours just to get your day to day done. If you are not a part of management, you will be micromanaged and bullied. It's frustrating and there is ZERO culture and morale is often quite low because of this.;
3;Startup Environment Flat Organisation Young people;Too little compensation Not suited for a family man/woman;
1;Makes every job after it look dreamy;"You're expected to work many more hours than advertised. Management is as clueless as it is opinionated. ""Self starter and independant"" is their keyword for ""Our priorities will change every hour and we'll shoot you down for not being able to guess"". In the middle of an epidemic, management still requires the employees to come to the office for one to ones, under the guise of it being a ""core service"". Don't trust the positive reviews, employees are ""encouraged"" to write them by HR.";"Get a grip. You're not Steve Jobs. You're not managing a billion dollar unicorn. You're an online bank offering ok service at best at five times the price of a mainstream bank. Your ""survival of the fittest"" management style leads anyone that has better options to leave"
1;They have a lot of work.;The company has many flaws. The most important is that the working hours aren't flexible. So, even if there's an emergency at your home, you either come to the office or take the day off. Second is that most customers are frustrated and want to cancel their membership. Even the pay is not that good.;Be honest to customers and make working hours more flexible.
1;It is still a job that gives regular paychecks.;The job is too exhausting and draining. Working in customer support is hard but what makes it harder is when the management already knows the customer's complaints and usual issues and yet there's no action being taken. We're just asked to offer discounts, promos to make an irate customer a little bit happier. It is very difficult especially when all the customer wants is refund and to get out of the membership.;Make things better by actually making changes that would benefit the customers and not just promises.
1;Great product with a wonderful UX;Incredible micromanagement, high stress, low collaboration, no work-life balance. Bunq is run like a factory with an extremely authoritative (sometimes shouting) boss. You’re expected to show up before 9, and leave after 6. And don’t think about emailing your daily status report a minute before 6 or you’re in trouble. Where you will sit/work has been determined by the CEO, and switches every couple of months. So you get back to the office & discover you have to sit somewhere else. This is never with your team, with the idea that you get to know colleagues from different departments, but it severely affects teamwork. Furthermore: there are two ‘wings’ to the office, and everybody prefers to be in the one where Ali (the CEO) is not, which is telling. You get KPIs to work towards and other goals that are largely nonsense, furthermore: because they are your individual goals, other people or departments have no incentive to work with you or help you out if it doesn’t directly help their goals. The bullying and pressure from the CEO on everybody creates a toxic culture. People who have had jobs before quickly leave because they recognize the insanity. The ones who stay are just out of school, and/or got looped in by their roommates to work there, so they get to work the insanity with their friends. One reason why the CEO might be such an ******* is that he is investing a lot of his personal funds into the company. If you add up all the costs of salaries, servers etc, and look at the amount of users, you see quickly that bunq won’t last.;"To HR: You know the work environment is toxic, so please stop responding here about pointless yoga hours; but please fix that you won’t get screamed at when you start at 9.05. To the CEO: The product you gave built is impressive, but when other banks get their **** together, it won’t survive. You’ve had a couple of great ideas (and a lot of money to fund bunq), but if you want to win, you need ideas from your team, and to foster a culture of trust, collaboration & creativity"
2;The people are pretty cool and chill.. its a nice environment I mean we all suffer together so that brings us closer. I actually liked the product.. was even considering switching my bank to bunq but not anymore.. Its also very international.. like 30 nationalities or something like that so you get to learn a lot from other people cause their all very friendly. But people come and go so fast that I didnt even bother learning their names.;"Where do I start ???? Salaries are pretty low ! Below market standards Beware of the reviews here, there are a lot of fake ones that HR writes !! If the review has CEO approval it's FAKE !! They push you to be on your own.. Everyone has crazy kpi's and teamwork is kinda discouraged cause everybody needs to do their own thing. Everything needs to be approved by the CEO and if he doesnt like something, your screwed and you need to start over, even if you have good arguments. Management is either too inexperienced or very old school, no in between. People are promoted only if they are yes men even if they dont have the experience. People who really know what they are doing tend to leave quickly.. while I was working there I saw like 3 heads of design leave in less than 2 months !! Your expected to do long hours.. sometimes even on the weekends but your still expected to be there from 9-6. Oh thats right, we have 40 hour contracts but in reality we work 45 hours and on fridays we are all expected to stay for the 'weekly' after 6pm, a moment where the CEO just rambles about things that happened last week for extra unpaid 20-30min where we just need to sit and clap for him..We were forced to report everything we did daily and if you miss your status report more than one day your in trouble ! We also need to do weekly reports and have weekly meetings with the team leads so they supervise everything all the time.

If you dont agree with the management, your considered a problem and they say things like 'this is not how we do things around here'.. A guy was fired on the spot last year for being too 'opinionated' and talking back to the management but the teammates told me he was actually really good at his job and nobody saw it coming, specially that guy !!

If you have other options, dont come here. If you want to scape your country and use this as a stepping stone for something nicer then apply here.. everyone says life after Bunq is much better and its very true !!";Stop micromanaging!! You ask us to measure all that data all the time but so many things are broken that the data is not even good. Trust your employees and value them. You loose much more money treating people poorly so they leave and you need to hire new people every month..
1;Free flow of beer and free food, the amenities, and office space;The managers are too bossy and like controlling everyone even their decision of working overtime.;Check if the managers have the right attitude in to be in that position
1;You'll earn some knowledge about the industry and get some useful experience. The pay is okay too.;There's too much going on. Tasks and deadline are inefficiently handled, and management is incapable of proper task delegation. And if you're unlucky, you'll have a manager who'll watch your every move. Also, most employees here are overworked and are forced to work overtime.;
1;Everything is new. The environment, the culture, the people. It's a breath of fresh air the first time you enter the office.;The work environment is very fast paced as they are a technology centered company. You better keep up with it or be left out and kicked out of the door, literally. Most of the employees are young and are very competitive even within the team. If you are the traditional type of worker, you won't last long in this company.;Give a little more time to those people who are still trying to adapt to the office culture and environment.
1;It's a fast-paced, dynamic environment that is full of energy and never gets boring.;The company surrounded with younger people and that makes up the culture of the company. If you are more on the older side, you will feel left out. Aside from the fast-paced, dynamic work environment, you also have to catch up with the young culture to have a smooth working relationship.;It's a good to have mix of employees at work so no one gets left out.
3;- if you have recently graduated, are new to the country or to the sector, this is a great place because they care more about your intelligence and potential than your experience - the company is truly international and the working language is english, there will be no discussions about this, you don't have to repeatedly ask people to please switch to english - the colleagues are great, you'll meet a lot of cool people. you'll never face any sort of sexism, racism, homophobia here, not because a policy says so, but because the people are truly not sexist, racist or homophobic. a millennial workplace.;"- the salary is below average and there is no possibility to renegotiate it. there's also no other benefits whatsoever. - people come and go constantly, the fluctuation is insane, the average employee stays less than a year. HR and management are okay with this and have no interest in trying to keep you, people are treated as replaceable - there is no concept of career development plan, or any kind of development plan. - because they already expect that you will leave in a short time, they don't invest much into your training. you get trained on your operational tasks, but nothing about programs, theory, etc. - the managers are not people with relevant experience, they are simply the employees who've stuck around the longest (1-2 years). this means they have no management skills and no real power - delivering perfection is expected, there is no acknowledgement or reward for good performance. on the other hand, the teams are constantly short staffed, so there's also no consequences for underperformance - if you opinion differs from the status quo, it will be ignored - working conditions are not flexible at all (you have to fight to work from home, there's 0 possibility to work flexible hours, you will constantly work overtime yet have to ask for 30 min of holiday if you need to leave early) - as an employee, you get the general vibe (especially from HR) that you don't matter at all: complaints are rarely dealt with in a positive manner, ""if you don't like something, you can leave"" is the general principle";you invest so much effort into hiring great people, invest a little more into trying to keep them happy!
1;People are great and welcoming. Very international environment.;"Where to start? Some companies care about their employees, some don’t. - The company culture revolves around micro-management. Expect the management style to be autocratic / authoritative. If you like thinking for yourself and standing up for your own opinion, then bunq isn’t for you. - A few Team leads must have been brainwashed and ended up losing common sense and becoming obedient because they fear the CEO. They get extreme pressure from him and sadly, they play along and contribute to the nasty atmosphere by projecting their stress on their team and micro-managing them as if they were kids. Quite disheartening and outraging. - On your first day, you’re required to download the internal chat app on your phone as well as your work email because you ""have to be reachable at all times."" The same goes for your work computer: you are expected to bring it home every evening so you can work extra hours for free. - No training provided when you start. You’re on your own and depending on your team, you might not get any support from your Manager because she/he either doesn’t know any better because too inexperienced or is too busy responding to all unreasonable demands from the CEO. - When you start, you don’t necessarily get to meet the people from your team as there’s a random seating plan. Don’t you dare plan a meeting with someone you’ll be working with to meet them and align on things or else you might get a remark from your Manager reminding you that most things don’t require talking face to face. Human interaction at its best.

- Zero flexibility: you better not arrive 5 min late or you could possibly get a warning.

- Forget about work-life balance, especially if you’re a Developer or Product Owner. The CEO will harass you on the internal chat until 1 a.m. if needed if you haven’t answered his numerous questions.

- The CEO is shameless and won’t hesitate to criticize employees leaving at 6 p.m. because he just assumes none of them has a life.

- Get ready to be infantilized and have to justify yourself in a written way for the pettiest things if something “went wrong.”

- Toxic environment overall, despite a lot of people being great and doing their best to make you feel good there, such as the HR team. Unfortunately, they can’t do much and are not listened to by the CEO.

- Working hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. BUT with a 30-minute lunch break only, meaning that in reality, everyone works at least 42.5 hours a week instead of 40.

- Sick leave: many companies in the Netherlands will pay you 100% of your salary if you get sick. Not bunq. - All of the above-mentioned points lead to some very unhappy employees. Some of them leaving after a few weeks, some hanging in there because they need to, some even burning themselves out… really sad to witness.

- Last but not least: don’t trust the 5* reviews - most of them are fake.";Advice to employees instead : let’s stop with this whole ‘it can always be worse’ mentality and focus on how much better off you could be by working at another company giving you appreciation, freedom, respect, trust and more benefits! Do yourself a favor and find yourself a better workplace.
2;great atmosphere, fun colleagues and good lunch/dinner;very low salary, but expected to give your all to the company and constantly work overtime without getting paid for it;
2;Great people, international environment with smart and open-minded colleagues. Good opportunity for people who are still figuring out what to do with their career. Not so great if you want ro grow in your field.;"Design is not valued at bunq, it's there to make sure they use all the colors of the rainbow. I would never recommend this place to a Designer, unless you want to be treated like a monkey i.e. being told what to do by inexperienced people. This place completely annihilated my creativity. Shaming and insults are bunq's means of constructive feedback. The CEO's behavior is dehumanizing. Your professional opinion is worthless unless it's in line with his. You're expected to work extra due to someone else's mismanagement of time. Company culture? You're either in or out. If you're ""out"", and by that, I mean avoiding a burn-out, you won't be eligible to any compensation. Even if you take on more work than you should.";Stop writing fake reviews and fix internal problems. Don't expect people to take on double the work for the love of the company, compensate the exceptions they make to get things done. Have some respect for your employees and don't cross boundaries. You hire smart people... so why shut them down?
1;You are often invited to parties and drinks on Fridays.;Thigh there is a plenty wrong with this company, the thing I hate most are the non-flexible working hours. Even if you are injured of you kid is sick., they won't allow you to be flexible with the working hours or change your shift. You are expected to be on your duty when they want you to.;Allow flexible hours, or your loyal employees will quit and become freelancers one day.
2;International team, great product, fast working pace. Truly a place to develop your skills in an ever-changing environment.;However, one skill you'll definitely develop is patience and resilience towards the negative comments thrown at you. This is the only place where the management's comments were personal, not only about my work performance. Feedback was inconsistent and confusing. Walls truly have ears at bunq too, so watch out for that. Also, they reach out to ex-employees asking if they submitted a negative comment at Glassdoor, and, if they did, ask them to edit it.;
1;- Things move fast, but the codebase is still great. - Big responsibilities since day one. - Learned a lot, it has some really smart engineers.;"- Management is almost on the harassment side. On my time in the company I have been publicly called ""a ret*rd"", ""a new level of stupidity"" and many similar expressions. - Got merge requests rejected with ""this is stupid, don't waste my time"" as the only explanation, and it turned out that it was because the CEO did not like the names used for a function. - I have been publicly shamed for mistakes I did due to the excessive pressure. - I have been forced to stay working until 10pm, and on weekends, but have received warnings for arriving 9:10am - No one has space to add ideas, nor the motivation to think creatively. - Salary is not in line with the expectations. - The CEO believes that he can do whatever he wants, including changing his pants in a glass meeting room. - I would never recommend a friend to work here, and no other employee I talked with would. HR admitted to add fake reviews here to compensate the disgusting facts.";Respect people and different points of views.
5;You will gain responsibilities at a rapid pace, and get lots of opportunities to develop yourself. The product is ahead of the competition, and the competition keeps a close eye on it. The company culture is very social, and there are frequent company events. The team I worked with was full of extremely talented people, many of which are still at bunq.;You will have to commit yourself to the high work pace, but if you do you will have a great time and learn a lot.;
5;I had been looking for a truly international company to work for after my boyfriend moved to Amsterdam. Came across bunq because of the happy colors, never left since. The company is a great mix of go-getters, international set of people and diversity. Somehow it pushes to do your best, every day. I haven't come across anything like it and I thoroughly enjoy being here.;The first weeks are hard. You either make it or you don't, there is no in-between.;Keep going. After being here for so long I know how difficult it can be, especially in a country like the Netherlands, but we're doing great things and that means everything.
4;If you understand how things work at bunq, you can have a large impact quickly. You must like this over the perks traditional banks offer (a lot of money, paid overtime, working from home or getting a car). Bunq will not offer any of those perks. It solely offers the oppertunity to get a lot done. This is unique to most other jobs I have had. Next to that the Food, the pace and people are great;Both the up as downside of bunq is that expectations are super high. Some people like this but for some people bunq simply does not work. They get scared by direct feedback or can’t handle high expectations. Sure, I also do not prefer working overtime or hearing why I was wrong about something. As long as you’re convinced it is for the greater good to fix it now and forever, you’ll make it at bunq. Otherwise maybe it is better to not work in a startup environment like bunq.;Wages could be a bit higher or compensation like a pensionscheme would be a big plus. It would make bunq a better place to be for people going forward in their lives (looking to buy a house etc). Keep eye out for extraordinary effort from employees. People at bunq will work on holidays/weekends to get important stuff done. They should earn a bit of slack because they went that extra mile.
